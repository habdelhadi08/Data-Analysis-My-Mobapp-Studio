# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio
My Mobapp Studio

## Task
In this task I am a Junior Data Scientist here at My MobApp Studio. Our engineering department decided we will allocate resource to create a new mobile app and I have to say that I have already received multiple emails showing the enthusiasm from our employees who wants to be part of the team. We have all in-house the different skills we need to make this project a success (marketing, design, game design, software engineer)
Before moving forward, I will need to create a report on the market. In order to complete our portfolio, this new App will be first publish on the Google Play Store, so we can focus our research on it.
I will just shoot some questions here:
What is the size of the market? numbers of download and $ Same question but per category? (percentages please) Depending on each category, what are the ratio of download per app? Any additional information you will find useful for us to take the right decision.
Great! Let`s dive in...

## Description
TWe had to create two files my_mobapp_studio and link_to_blog_post.txt.
First will be your notebook jupyter with your calculation You will have to implement multiple functions:
load_dataset()
# Analysis
print_summarize_dataset(dataset)
clean_dataset(dataset)
print_histograms(dataset)
compute_correlations_matrix(dataset)
print_scatter_matrix()
Second will be a report. You will publish it on any blog platform of your choice. To drive your Analysis:
Plot with bar diagram the most populars paid apps of Family category
Plot with a pie diagram the most popular genres according to the number of installations from paid family
An array with the number of installation per category
Plot a pie with the number of installation per category
Plot a bar with the mean price per category
Most expensive apps per category


## Installation
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Usage
to run my project: jupyter notebook
